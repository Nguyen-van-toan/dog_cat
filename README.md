# Dog and Cat Image Classification

## Overview

This project aims to classify images of dogs and cats using a machine learning model. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled images and evaluated for accuracy and performance. The main goal is to develop a reliable classifier that can distinguish between images of dogs and cats.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vantoan2905/dog_cat.git
   cd dog_cat
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of labeled images of dogs and cats. You can download the dataset from [Kaggle's Dogs vs. Cats dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data).

1. Download the dataset and extract it into the `data/` directory so that you have the following structure:

   ```
   data/
     ├── train/
     │   ├── cat.0.jpg
     │   ├── cat.1.jpg
     │   ├── ...
     │   ├── dog.0.jpg
     │   ├── dog.1.jpg
     │   ├── ...
     └── test/
         ├── 1.jpg
         ├── 2.jpg
         ├── ...
   ```

## Usage

To classify images using the trained model, run:

```bash
python classify.py --image path/to/your/image.jpg
```

This will output whether the image is classified as a dog or a cat.

## Model Training

To train the model from scratch, use the following command:

```bash
python train.py
```

This will train the model using the dataset located in the `data/train` directory and save the trained model to the `models/` directory.

## Evaluation

To evaluate the model's performance on the test set, use:

```bash
python evaluate.py
```

This will output the accuracy and other relevant metrics.

## Results

The final model achieves an accuracy of **X%** on the test set. Detailed results and analysis can be found in the `results/` directory.
